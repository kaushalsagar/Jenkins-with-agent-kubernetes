Docker build and push
---------------------


#docker build -f Dockerfile -t your_account_user/customize-jenkins-agent:latest .

#docker login

#docker push your_account_user/customize-jenkins-agent:latest






                                                  Step-2
                                                  ------
                                                  

Step-1)   Create three PVC ( jenkins-aws-credentials  ,  jenkins-aws-kubeconfig  , jenkins-slave-pvc-maven ) using efs as persistence storage 

* Here we are using efs storage so that our jenkins agent pod can schedule on any node.
* If we use block storage then there is a case jenkins agent start on different node which might be on different availability zone and in AWS block storage are specific to         availability zone.

Refer jenkins-pvc.yaml as per your environment.


                                                  Jenkins Installation using Helm
                                                  -------------------------------




*Edit jenkins-stable.yaml and edit line number 74,75 according to your username and password for Jenkins.

*Edit jenkins-stable.yaml and edit line number 224,225 and add your jenkins-agent-image-name and its version.




#helm repo add stable https://kubernetes-charts.storage.googleapis.com/

#Kubectl create ns jenkins

#helm install jenkins stable/jenkins -n jenkins -f jenkins-stable-values.yaml



Create a pipeline that runs around 20 mins so that you can exec into jenkins slave pod and copy your kubeconfig file as /root/.kube/config 
        and aws credential file as /root/.aws/credentials
